# Pricing & Features – Neura Dynamics

Note: Neura Dynamics typically uses custom, use-case-based pricing rather than fixed public price tiers.

## Pricing (High-Level)

- **Project-based pricing**  
  - Fixed-scope or milestone projects priced on complexity, timelines, and integrations.  
  - Includes design, development, testing, and deployment of AI solutions (e.g., chatbots, RAG systems, automation flows).

- **Retainer / Managed services**  
  - Monthly retainers for monitoring, optimization, LLM fine-tuning, and ongoing feature updates.  
  - Rates depend on support hours, SLAs, and environment scale (users, requests, models).  

- **Consulting and advisory**  
  - Short AI strategy or discovery engagements priced per workshop or per day.  
  - Outputs typically include AI roadmaps, architecture, and ROI estimates.

- **Custom / Enterprise**  
  - For large programs (multi-country, multi-product, strict compliance), pricing is fully custom and contract-based.  

For exact pricing, Neura Dynamics asks prospects to share use case details and then provides a tailored proposal.
