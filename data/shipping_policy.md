# Data Delivery & Access Policy – Neura Dynamics

## Overview
As a services and AI solutions company, Neura Dynamics does not ship physical products. This policy covers how we provision and deliver digital assets, environments, and documentation.

---

## Delivery Methods

### Project Deliverables
- Source code, configuration, and documentation are shared via secure repositories or workspaces agreed in the contract (e.g., Git, cloud repos, shared drives).
- Model artifacts, configurations, and infrastructure templates are delivered in exportable formats where applicable.
- Access to demo or staging environments is provided via authenticated URLs and role-based access.

### Platforms, APIs, and AI Agents
- Access to platforms, APIs, and AI agents is delivered through:
  - Secure login credentials or SSO.
  - API keys or service accounts managed per your security requirements.
- Provisioning typically occurs within **1–3 business days** after contract signing and initial setup completion.

---

## Processing and Access Time

- Standard onboarding and environment setup: usually **3–10 business days**, depending on scope and cloud/security requirements.
- Subscription access (where self-service is available): may be provisioned within **1 business day** after successful payment and verification.
- Any special security reviews or VPN/VPC peering may extend timelines; these are communicated during onboarding.

## Access Issues and Interruptions

### Access or Delivery Problems
- If you are unable to access a platform, API, or environment, contact **support@neuradynamics.ai** with details (environment, error, urgency).
- We will investigate and work with your team and our cloud providers to restore access as quickly as possible.
- In case of prolonged service-impacting issues attributable to Neura Dynamics, service credits may be considered in line with your contract.

### Data Transfer and Handover
- At project close or termination, we can support data and asset handover (code, configurations, model artifacts) as agreed in the SoW/MSA.
- Handover may involve secure file transfer, repository transfer, or documented procedures; some activities may be billable.

---

## Security and Compliance

- All digital delivery is performed using secure, industry-standard channels (e.g., encrypted connections, authenticated portals).
- Access is limited to authorized users designated by your organization and aligned with your security policies.
- Any regulatory or compliance-specific delivery requirements (e.g., data residency, logging, audit trails) are handled per the contract.
