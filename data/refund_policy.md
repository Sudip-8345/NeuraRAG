---

## Eligibility for Refunds

### Projects and Services
- For fixed-scope or T&M projects, refunds are not given for completed work.
- If service quality materially deviates from the agreed SoW/MSA, we may offer a partial or full refund or service credit after review.
- Prepaid amounts for work not yet performed may be refunded or credited, subject to contract terms and any committed third-party costs.

### Subscriptions and Platform Access
- Monthly and annual subscription fees are generally **non-refundable** once a billing period has started.
- Exceptions may be considered in cases of sustained, verified technical issues where we are unable to restore service within a reasonable time; in such cases, we may issue pro‑rated credits rather than cash refunds.

### Training, Workshops, and Events
- If a paid session is cancelled by Neura Dynamics with no reschedule option, you may choose a full refund or a credit toward future sessions.
- If you cancel within the allowed cancellation window under our cancellation policy, applicable refunds or credits will follow that policy.

## Refund Processing
- Approved refunds are typically processed within **7–10 business days**.
- Refunds are issued to the **original payment method** where possible; otherwise, a credit note or service credit may be provided.
- Bank or card processor timelines may add a few additional business days.

---

## Conditions and Restrictions
- A valid contract, invoice, or payment reference is required to assess refund eligibility.
- Non‑recoverable third-party costs (cloud reservations, licenses, paid datasets, etc.) are not refundable once incurred.
- Where local law provides stronger customer rights, those rights will prevail over this policy.
